# Beep

> Beep was a easy rated box on the platform hackthebox.eu.
> The box was a website with multiple login. 
> There was a CVE involved to gain access was no need for privilege escalation.

## Recon
First we run nmap against the box and see what we get.
```

After we have a look at the nmap output we see port 22 ssh is open and some http ports aswell and bunch of other stuff. Basically I was looking at port `80`, `443` and `10000` and looked them up in the browser.

> Port `80` & `443` redirected us both to the elastix web login

> Port `10000` shows us a webmin login

At first I looked more into the elastix login. I inspected the website first and saw a elastix version. Basically I just searched up the exploits for this version of elastix. So I found two interesting exploits I tried.

## Gain Access

Actually there perl written file inclusion, which I tried to better understand and wrote it in python.
My repo for the rewritten exploit: https://github.com/daniboomberger/elastix_lfi
Sadly there was to many problems with the expired certificate, because it is a old box. After some time and trying the other exploit, which also had the expired certificate problem.... I tried the local file inclusion manually.
Manually it looked like that `https://<TARGET-IP>/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action`

> Output of the local file inclusion looked as below in the picture

With some dedication and the lovely search function we found a admin login.
`{admin:jEhdIekWmdjE}`

After that I tried the login credentials on the elastix login and we are in the admin panel. Sadly I totally forgot to look again at my nmap output, which you definitely should do. I was searching for a way to upload a reverse shell and execute it. A while I did go back to the nmap output and we see the open ssh port. So we trying out to connect multiple times always get a diffie-hellman-group-exchange error. Some research later I tried this beautiful command.
`ssh -o KexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 root@10.10.10.7`
And passed my login password from earlier and boom we are in as root.

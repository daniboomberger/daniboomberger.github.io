> I'm a programmer and cyber security enthusiast. 
> This Blog is to share about my research and writeups I do about cyber security.
> Hopefully I learn more by sharing this and people who read my research about specific subjects.
> My programming languages to go are `python` or `C#`
> Btw I don't use Arch :) -> I use mostly Kali or Ubuntu
